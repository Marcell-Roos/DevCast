# DevCast – Cross-Post to Multiple Social Media Platforms

> A free, open source Python tool for developers to build an audience across multiple social platforms with minimal effort.

---

## ✨ Overview

**DevCast** is an open source, self-hostable tool that enables developers to cross-post content to multiple social media platforms with a single click. The project aims to simplify how developers share their work, thoughts, and updates across different networks—starting with X (formerly Twitter) and Bluesky.

Our vision is to reduce the overhead of maintaining a consistent presence on multiple platforms by offering a simple, reliable, and extensible tool built entirely in Python.

This project is ideal for:
- Developers who want to grow an audience
- Indie hackers building in public
- Open source maintainers promoting their work
- Anyone looking to streamline their posting workflow

---

## 🚧 Current Status

- ✅ **X (Twitter)** – OAuth + Posting support in development
- ✅ **Bluesky** – ATProto-based integration planned
- 🧩 **Other platforms** – Will be added based on availability of free/accessible APIs

*Note: Only X and Bluesky will be included in the initial MVP release.*

## ⚙️ Why Python?

We chose **Python** for its ease of use, cross-platform compatibility, and broad developer familiarity. Our goal is to keep installation, self-hosting, and customization as friendly as possible.

---

## 💡 Key Features (Planned)

- 🔗 Unified post composer with platform toggles
- 📆 Schedule posts in advance
- 🔍 Platform-specific preview
- 🔒 Secure local token storage (OAuth 1.0a / 2.0)
- 🎯 CLI and Web UI support
- 📦 Easy to self-host or run locally

---

## 📦 Installation & Usage

Usage instructions will be added soon. The project is designed to run as a local script currently

A `.env.example` file will be provided for managing API keys securely.

---

## 🧪 Who Is This For?

> This tool is currently intended for **developers** who are comfortable setting up Python environments and working with API keys.

While we plan to simplify usage in the future with a GUI, the initial versions assume a developer audience.

---

## 🔐 Security

If you're building this or showcasing it live
- API keys are handled via `.env` files (never printed or committed)
- Safe placeholder configs are included
- Redacted logs and fallbacks protect you during live demos
